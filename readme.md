Lab 3: Utah Roadtrip- My Top Pick Destinations
========================

This project was named "Utah Roadtrip- My Top Pick Destinations" because it is a curation of my favorite spots when I was road tripping in Utah. One of the major functions within this code is the style function which customized my map styling. Another major function was the use of functions to filter certain aspects of my map like layer.bindTooltip to create the popups on my web map. Libraries used on this map were leaflet and jQuery. My data sources for this map included OpenStreetMap_France for my base map and the National Park Service for my "shoutout" section. Other sources include google maps to create my route, and Maps to GPX to change my route into a format that was to be converted into a geoJson format with geojson.io. After these steps were completed, I used Atom to house all of my files and code my map.
